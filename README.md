AstralGen ...
... a Ray March based rendering Engine using Zig and Vulkan.

This project is mainly for educational purposes because I wanted to try something more modern after my previous OpenGL Projects and trying out Zig because of my frustration with the C++ (mostly the build System and header Files).
I want to extend this into an Asset Editor for an actual proper Game Engine that I can use for myself.
